        <h1><a href="../../index.html">THE STRANGER</a></h1>
<p>I entered the mortuary. It was a bright, spotlessly clean room, with whitewashed
walls and a big skylight. The furniture consisted of some chairs and trestles.
Two of the latter stood open in the center of the room and the coffin rested on
them. The lid was in place, but the screws had been given only a few turns and
their nickeled heads stuck out above the wood, which was stained dark walnut.
An Arab woman—a nurse, I supposed—was sitting beside the bier; she was wearing
a blue smock and had a rather gaudy scarf wound round her hair.</p>
<p>Just then the keeper came up behind me. He’d evidently been running, as he was a little out of breath.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“We put the lid on, but I was told to unscrew it when you came, so that you could see her.”</span></p>
<p>While he was going up to the coffin I told him not to trouble.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Eh? What’s that?”</span> he exclaimed. <span class="quote">“You don’t want me to ...?”</span></p>
<p><span class="quote">“No,”</span> I said.</p>
<p>He put back the screwdriver in his pocket and stared at me. I realized then that I
shouldn’t have said, <span class="quote">“No,”</span> and it made me rather embarrassed. After eying me for some moments he asked:</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Why not?”</span> But he didn’t sound reproachful; he simply wanted to know.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Well, really I couldn’t say,”</span> I answered.</p>
<p>He began twiddling his white mustache; then, without looking at me, said gently: <span class="quote">“I understand.”</span></p>
<p>He was a pleasant-looking man, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks. He drew up a
chair for me near the coffin, and seated himself just behind. The nurse got up and moved toward the door. As she was going by, the keeper whispered in my ear:</p>
<p><span class="quote">“It’s a tumor she has, poor thing.”</span></p>
<p>I looked at her more carefully and I noticed that she had a bandage round her head, just below her eyes. It lay quite flat across the bridge of her nose, and one saw hardly anything of her face except that strip of whiteness.</p>
<p>As soon as she had gone, the keeper rose.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Now I’ll leave you to yourself.”</span></p>
<p>I don’t know whether I made some gesture, but instead of going he halted behind
my chair. The sensation of someone posted at my back made me uncomfortable. The sun was getting low and the whole room was flooded with a pleasant, mellow light. Two hornets were buzzing overhead, against the skylight. I was so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. Without looking round, I asked the keeper how long he’d been at the Home. <br><span class="quote">“Five years.”</span> The answer came so pat that one could have thought he’d been expecting my question.</p>
<p>That started him off, and he became quite chatty. If anyone had told him ten years ago that he’d end his days as doorkeeper at a home at Marengo, he’d never have believed it. He was sixty-four, he said, and hailed from Paris.</p>
<p>When he said that, I broke in. <span class="quote">“Ah, you don’t come from here?”</span></p>
