<p> I had a feeling he was blaming me for something, and started to explain.
  But he cut me short. </p>
<p><span class="quote">“There’s no need to excuse yourself, my boy. I’ve looked
  up the record and obviously you weren’t in a position to see that she was properly
  cared for. She needed someone to be with her all the time, and young men in
  jobs like yours don’t get too much pay. In any case, she was much happier in the Home.”</span></p>
<p>I said, <span class="quote">“Yes, sir; I’m sure of that.”</span> </p>
<p> Then he added: <span class="quote">“She had good friends here, you know, old folks like herself,
and one gets on better with people of one’s own generation. You’re much too young;
you couldn’t have been much of a companion to her.”</span></p>
<p>That was so. When we lived together, Mother was always watching me, but we hardly
ever talked. During her first few weeks at the Home she used to cry a good deal.
But that was only because she hadn’t settled down. After a month or two she’d have
cried if she’d been told to leave the Home. Because this, too, would have been a
wrench. That was why, during the last year, I seldom went to see her. Also, it
would have meant losing my Sunday—not to mention the trouble of going to the bus,
getting my ticket, and spending two hours on the journey each way.</p>
<p>The warden went on talking, but I didn’t pay much attention. Finally he said:</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Now, I suppose you’d like to see your mother?”</span></p>
<p>I rose without replying, and he led the way to the door. As we were going down
the stairs he explained:</p>
<p><span class="quote">“I’ve had the body moved to our little mortuary—so as not to upset the other old
people, you understand. Every time there’s a death here, they’re in a nervous
state for two or three days. Which means, of course, extra work and worry for
our staff.”</span></p>
<p>We crossed a courtyard where there were a number of old men, talking amongst
themselves in little groups. They fell silent as we came up with them. Then,
behind our backs, the chattering began again. Their voices reminded me of
parakeets in a cage, only the sound wasn’t quite so shrill. The warden stopped
outside the entrance of a small, low building.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“So here I leave you, Monsieur Meursault. If you want me for anything, you’ll
find me in my office. We propose to have the funeral tomorrow morning. That will
enable you to spend the night beside your mother’s coffin, as no doubt you would
wish to do. Just one more thing; I gathered from your mother’s friends that she
wished to be buried with the rites of the Church. I’ve made arrangements for
this; but I thought I should let you know.”</span></p>
<p>I thanked him. So far as I knew, my mother, though not a professed atheist, had
never given a thought to religion in her life.</p>
