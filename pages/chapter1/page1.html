        <h1><a href="../../cover.html">THE STRANGER</a></h1>

<p>MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure. The telegram from
  the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW.
    DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been
    yesterday. </p>
<p>The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With
  the two o’clock bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend
  the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by
  tomorrow evening. I have fixed up with my employer for two days’ leave; obviously,
  under the circumstances, he couldn’t refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed,
  and I said, without thinking: <span class="quote">“Sorry, sir, but it’s not my
    fault, you know.”</span></p>
<p>Afterwards it struck me I needn’t have said that. I had no reason to excuse
  myself; it was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth. Probably he will
  do so the day after tomorrow, when he sees me in black. For the present, it’s
  almost as if Mother weren’t really dead. The funeral will bring it home to me,
  put an official seal on it, so to speak. ... </p>
<p>I took the two-o’clock bus. It was a blazing hot afternoon. I’d lunched, as usual,
at Céleste’s restaurant. Everyone was most kind, and Céleste said to me,
<span class="quote">“There’s no one like a mother.”</span> When I left they came
with me to the door. It was something of a rush, getting away, as at the last
moment I had to call in at Emmanuel’s place to borrow his black tie and mourning
band. He lost his uncle a few months ago.</p>
<p>I had to run to catch the bus. I suppose it was my hurrying like that, what with
the glare off the road and from the sky, the reek of gasoline, and the jolts,
that made me feel so drowsy. Anyhow, I slept most of the way. When I woke I was
leaning against a soldier; he grinned and asked me if I’d come from a long way
off, and I just nodded, to cut things short. I wasn’t in a mood for talking.</p>
<p>The Home is a little over a mile from the village. I went there on foot. I asked
to be allowed to see Mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me I must see the
warden first. He wasn’t free, and I had to wait a bit. The doorkeeper chatted
with me while I waited; then he led me to the office. The warden was a very
small man, with gray hair, and a Legion of Honor rosette in his buttonhole. He
gave me a long look with his watery blue eyes. Then we shook hands, and he held
mine so long that I began to feel embarrassed. After that he consulted a register
on his table, and said:</p>
<p><span class="quote">“Madame Meursault entered the Home three years ago. She
  had no private means and depended entirely on you.”</span></p>
