        <h1><a href="../../index.html">THE STRANGER</a></h1>
<p>I remembered then that, before taking me to the warden, he’d told me something about Mother. He had said she’d have to be buried mighty quickly because of the
  heat in these parts, especially down in the plain. <span class="quote">“At Paris they keep the body for three days, sometimes four.”</span> After that he had mentioned that he’d spent the best part of his life in Paris, and could never manage to forget it. <span class="quote">“Here,”</span> he had said, <span class="quote">“things have to go with a rush, like. You’ve hardly time to get used to the idea that someone’s dead, before you’re hauled off to the funeral.” “That’s enough,”</span> his wife had put in. <span class="quote">“You didn’t ought to say such things to the poor young gentleman.”</span> The old fellow had blushed and begun to apologize. I told him it was quite all right. As a matter of fact, I found it rather interesting, what he’d been telling me; I hadn’t thought of that before.</p>
<p>Now he went on to say that he’d entered the Home as an ordinary inmate. But he was still quite hale and hearty, and when the keeper’s job fell vacant, he offered to take it on.</p>
<p>I pointed out that, even so, he was really an inmate like the others, but he wouldn’t hear of it. He was <span class="quote">“an official, like.”</span> I’d been struck before by his habit of saying <span class="quote">“they”</span> or, less often, <span class="quote">“them old folks,”</span> when referring to inmates no older than himself. Still, I could see his point of view. As doorkeeper he had a certain standing, and some authority over the rest of them.</p>
<p>Just then the nurse returned. Night had fallen very quickly; all of a sudden, it seemed, the sky went black above the skylight. The keeper switched on the lamps, and I was almost blinded by the blaze of light.</p>
<p>He suggested I should go to the refectory for dinner, but I wasn’t hungry. Then he proposed bringing me a mug of café au lait. As I am very partial to café au lait I said, <span class="quote">“Thanks,”</span> and a few minutes later he came back with a tray. I drank the coffee, and then I wanted a cigarette. But I wasn’t sure if I should smoke, under the circumstances—in Mother’s presence. I thought it over; really, it didn’t seem to matter, so I offered the keeper a cigarette, and we both smoked.</p>
<p>After a while he started talking again.</p>
<p><span class="quote">“You know, your mother’s friends will be coming soon, to keep vigil with you beside the body. We always have a ‘vigil’ here, when anyone dies. I’d better go and get some chairs and a pot of black coffee.”</span></p>
<p>The glare off the white walls was making my eyes smart, and I asked him if he couldn’t turn off one of the lamps. <span class="quote">“Nothing doing,”</span> he said. They’d arranged the lights like that; either one had them all on or none at all. After that I didn’t pay much more attention to him. He went out, brought some chairs, and set them out round the coffin. On one he placed a coffeepot and ten or a dozen cups. Then he sat down facing me, on the far side of Mother. The nurse was at the other end of the room, with her back to me. I couldn’t see what she was doing, but by the way her arms moved I guessed that she was knitting. I was feeling very comfortable; the coffee had warmed me up, and through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of cool night air. I think I dozed off for a while.</p>
